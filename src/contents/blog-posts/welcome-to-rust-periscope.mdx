### 🔭 Rust Periscope

A bi-weekly and monthly video cast that focused on teaching rust, discussing use-cases and practices of Rust, alongside encouraging every Rustacean with insightful interviews from Rust community members.

### 🗒 Summary

I'm planning to start a youtube channel focused on rust, of which the first video release is slated for the end of this month or next.

### ❓ Problem statement:

On close examintation into the rust community,

- I discovered that there was little to no video content on doing building simple to complex projects in rust.

- Also, while starting up with rust, I always wanted first-hand experience on best practices, tools, techinqiues on building, testing and deploying solid projects in rust.

- I needed constant motivation (i.e. knowing I wasn't the only one who struggled a lot with the borrow checker).

### 🚧 Solution:

I am proposing the following approaches to help grow the rust community:

- **Rust a little**:

  - **Releases:** Bi-weekly (10 - 15 minutes)
  - **Description:** Teach basics of rust.

- **Hacking with rust**

  - **Releases:** Bi-weekly (10 - 15 minutes)
  - **Description:** Building usable projects using Rust Lang.
  - **Approach:** Use forms to harvest products to build.

- **Interviewing Rustaceans:**
  - **Releases:** Once every month (10 - 20 minutes).
  - **Description:** A very short interview with members of the Rust Community, alongside speaking with them on how they've used rust either in production or their side projects.

### 🎉 Relase Date

First release is slated between `August, 2019` to `September, 2019`.

### 💡 Suggestions

Any form of suggestions would be of great help. 🙏

### 🤔 Am I The Best Fit ?

I've improved a whole lot in writing rust, but not to my expectation, but I'm willing to grow along the way.
