Taking a cue from how an army of soldiers could be organised and dispatched
in troops to perform diverse independent missions, which can be termed a division-driven
approach; Such an approach could also be utilized in controlling autpiloted drones remotely and
efficiently. Individual division of drones could then be dispatched to diverse geo-location,
to perform or execute missions that could be independent.

With managing such a structure, comes a great price. Join Tochukwu as he discusses
how he used Rust to improve performance of the swarm, alongside the approachs taken
to handle diverse engineering challenges ranging from ensuring minimal latency,
prompt response to change of mission assigned to division, scaling to support diverse UAVs
including but not limited to rovers, boats, etc., disconnection from swarm (loss of communication).
